 One record reply trivial DNS based on sendmsg and recvmmsg OS functions.


 This is an simple example for my students about creating network services
 at Go. It show using of sendmsg and recvmsg from Go.

 Also, I would like to deliver my expressions about Go, compare it with
 Erlang. For me this weekend was under Go flag. 
 I never write code at go before, but now, after one day deep coding I can write on Go.
 It easy language with good speed of creating pilot projects.
 The main time was spent on slices,arrays and tuples sintaxis, variable
 initializations. Unfortunally it not such rock-solid and stable as Erlang
 on high load. At least for me, nuewbie for Golang. It like C (or Slang) but with more
 comfortable sintaxis and some modern nuts and belts.

 COMPILATION:

 Just type
 $make 

 Watch out, at old OS, like Debian Wheezy you can get errors:

./one_dns_msg.go:13: imported and not used: "unsafe"
./one_dns_msg.go:79: undefined: Sendmsg

 It means what such function does not supported by Go in this OS.

 TESTS:

 Run it as root and test resolving by nslookup 1000.dip 127.0.0.1 
 and then do benchmarks by dnsperf or something else
